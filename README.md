  When a forager bee finds nectar, it doesn't carry the whole field home — it dances the
  <em>direction and the distance</em> so the rest of the colony can go straight there.
  Waggle Dance does that for your agents: one browser tab that shows every project, every
  running agent, every thing waiting on you — and lets you answer, without ever becoming
  another editor.

## The problem it solves

You are no longer writing the code. You are running four agents across three repositories,
each one halfway through something, each one occasionally stuck on a question only you can
answer. The state of that colony lives in a dozen scrollback buffers, a `.bee/` store, and
your memory.

Waggle Dance is the surface you watch it from. It reads every project you register — the
docs the agents write, the source they change, the workflow state they keep — rolls it up
into one board, and puts the agents' own terminals one click away. **You conduct. You don't
type code here.**

| | |
|---|---|
| 🐝 **One board, every project** | The front page rolls up features across every registered project into a single flat list — what's waiting on you, what's in progress, what shipped. |
| ✋ **"Waiting on you" is a real column** | A feature stopped at an unapproved gate, or paused mid-handoff, surfaces itself. You stop discovering blockers by scrolling. |
| 🖥️ **Talk to the agents** | Watch any agent's live screen, type a reply, send the keys that matter — arrows, Enter, Escape, Tab, Ctrl+C. Attach an image to a message. |
| 🗂️ **Every agent, one drawer** | A slide-in list of every agent across every project, grouped by status. Switch panes without switching windows. |
| 📖 **Read the docs** | Whole-project markdown: cross-folder links that never 404, full-text search (SQLite FTS5), Mermaid you can pan and zoom, live reload on save. |
| 💻 **Read the code** | A second reading surface: the project's source as it sits on disk, syntax-coloured, line-numbered. For pointing at a line, not for changing it. |
| 🤖 **Agent-native** | Four MCP tools: `waggledance_view_file` hands a clickable URL the moment an agent writes a doc; `waggledance_search`, `waggledance_projects`, and `waggledance_ask_state` let it query docs and bee state cross-project instead of re-reading files. |
| 📱 **Conduct from a phone** | Responsive layout, sidebar drawer, light & dark. Over the LAN or an SSH tunnel. |
| 🦀 **One binary** | Rust. No runtime, no Node, no Docker. |

waggledance doctor --fix     # wire up Claude Code MCP integration
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanhsmind/waggledance/main/install.ps1 | iex
waggledance doctor --fix     # wire up Claude Code MCP integration
```

Or from source (needs Rust):

The CLI binary is `waggledance`.

---

## Use in 30 seconds

```sh
waggledance open docs/architecture.md
```

The daemon **auto-starts**, indexes the project, resolves the links, and prints a browser
URL. Open <http://localhost:7700> to reach the board over every project you've registered.

**Conducting from a remote machine over SSH?** Forward the port and browse locally:

```sh
ssh -L 7700:localhost:7700 user@host   # then open http://localhost:7700
```

## The board

Per project, top to bottom:

1. **Live** — who is running right now in this project.
2. **Feature Hub** — *Waiting on you*, *In Progress*, *Finished*, as cards.
3. **Shipped** — the finished list.
4. **Backlog & Review** — backlog items, findings, the review queue.

The front page is the cross-project view: one flat, merged feature list across every
project that carries a `.bee/` store, so you see the whole colony before you pick a hive.
Cross-project cards mark which features have a terminal session running in their checkout,
and link straight to it.

**The board relays; it never decides.** It writes in exactly two ways — through the
project's own `bee` CLI, or as one line into a herdr pane — and only on an explicit human
click, in a project where you switched board actions on in settings. Three answers live on
a feature card: approve or reject the UAT gate, the merged shape+execution gate, or an
agent's permission prompt. Three more start work: **Start** on a Todo card,
**Run review**, and **Run compound** — each starts an agent, in the feature's own live
pane when one exists, and otherwise in a fresh pane opened in the feature's worktree with
the project's default bee preset. One board-started run per feature is live at a time; while
it runs, that card's buttons stand down and the card says what is running. The board
carries your decision there and mirrors what came back; it originates none of its own. A project without the switch shows only the badge
that says something is waiting on you.

## Talking to the agents

Waggle Dance never runs a terminal of its own. It talks to a running
**[herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr)** and shows you the panes herdr already
manages. No herdr, and the tab says so plainly rather than breaking.

- **Terminal** tab — the agent's live screen, poll-refreshed, ~200 lines of scrollback.
- **Transcript** tab — that agent's own gap-free activity log.
- **Reply** — typed text is *staged*, then sent on your word. Keys (arrows, Enter, Escape,
  Tab, Ctrl+C) send immediately. Images attach to a message; attachments live outside the
  project folder, so replying never dirties a repository.
- **Start an agent** — from a preset or a plain shell.

Two background duties exist and are **off by default**: keeping herdr alive, and notifying
you when an agent's status changes.

> **tmux as a transport is not implemented.** herdr is the only backend today. Driving
> plain tmux sessions directly is on the roadmap, not in the binary.

---

## Reading surfaces

Beside each project's name is a section switch:

- **Docs** — the whole project's markdown at any folder depth. Every internal link
  (`../`, `./sub/`, anchors) is rewritten into one URL namespace, so nothing 404s. Full-text
  search and fuzzy file-jump. A filesystem watcher pushes reloads over WebSocket.
- **Code** — the project's source files, folders before files, syntax-coloured and
  line-numbered. Same containment rule: nothing outside the project root is ever served.

Neither surface edits. Line numbers exist so a line can be pointed at.

---

## Agent integration (MCP)

```sh
waggledance doctor --fix
```

Registers an MCP server for whichever of **Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity** it detects
on your machine — it never writes config for a tool you don't have — exposing four tools:

- **`waggledance_view_file(project_root, relative_path)`** → a clickable `url` to the rendered
  file, **auto-registering** the project and indexing it on first use.
- **`waggledance_search(query, project?, limit?)`** → full-text hits across every registered
  project's indexed markdown, or just `project` when given. Re-indexes changed files in the
  searched project(s) first and reports any project whose refresh failed (`structuredContent.refresh`)
  — search still returns hits either way, flagged rather than silently stale. Each hit carries a
  `<mark>`-highlighted excerpt — enough to answer without a follow-up read, never a bare path list
  or a whole file. `limit` caps hit count (default 10).
- **`waggledance_projects()`** → every registered project's `id`, `name`, `root_path`,
  `file_count`, and `last_seen_at`. `file_count` reflects the index as-is and may lag until the
  next search touches that project.
- **`waggledance_ask_state(project?)`** → parsed `.bee/` state, no file reads required. Omit
  `project` for a rollup across every registered project; pass it for one project's full
  snapshot (feature, phase, mode, open/blocked/stuck cells, recent decisions, sessions,
  handoff, attention). A project with no `.bee/` reports absent, never an error.

Drop the snippet from [`docs/waggledance-agents-template.md`](docs/waggledance-agents-template.md)
into your project's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` and your agents will hand you a viewable URL
the moment they finish writing, and can query docs and bee state cross-project instead of
re-reading files.

## CLI

```sh
waggledance open <file.md>                # print the browser URL (auto-starts the daemon)
waggledance register <dir> [--name ...]   # recursive scan + index a project
waggledance search "query"                # full-text search (FTS5)
waggledance status                        # is the daemon up?
waggledance config edit                   # edit ~/.waggledance/config.toml in $EDITOR
waggledance restart                       # restart the daemon (apply config changes)
waggledance doctor [--fix]                # diagnose & repair the integration
waggledance serve [--host H] [--port P]   # optional: pre-start / bind a custom address
```

Most commands accept `--json`. Full reference, SSH workflows, and settings live in the
**[usage guide](docs/usage.md)**.

---

## How it works

One daemon owns the registry (`~/.waggledance/registry.db`); browser tabs are just clients. On a
`view_file` call the server auto-creates the project, scans it recursively, indexes the
target file, resolves its links, and returns the URL. A filesystem watcher keeps the index
current and pushes reload signals over WebSocket. Board data is read from each project's
`.bee/` store; terminal data comes from herdr over its socket.

- **Rendering:** comrak (GFM) → server-side syntect highlight → ammonia sanitize. Mermaid renders client-side.
- **Search:** SQLite FTS5.
- **Containment:** only registered project roots are served; path traversal is guarded and project HTML is sanitized before it's sent.

## Security — read this before exposing it

**Waggle Dance has no authentication.** Not on the board, not on the docs, not on the code
view, not on the terminal.

The terminal family is **off until you switch it on** in settings, and a second switch is
needed before agents outside every registered project root become visible. Both are off by
default for a reason: an exposed daemon with the terminal switch on is *unauthenticated
remote code execution*, because replying to an agent pane is arbitrary input to a shell.

Bind it to localhost. Reach it over SSH forwarding, a VPN, or an authenticating reverse
proxy. `waggledance serve --host 0.0.0.0` on a network you don't fully trust is not a
supported posture. Details in the [usage guide](docs/usage.md).

---

## Status

Actively developed. Docs viewer, code viewer, project-wide search, the cross-project board,
the agent terminal over herdr, MCP + CLI + `doctor`, and the mobile UX all work end-to-end.
A native desktop shell (Tauri) is experimental. A fleet-wide analytics rollup and a tmux
transport are known gaps, not shipped features. See [PRD.md](PRD.md) for the full design.

## Credits

Waggle Dance grew out of a markdown viewer and kept its ancestry. It also absorbs
[herdr-go](https://github.com/vantt/herdr-go) — the agent-terminal experiment that preceded
it, now retired. Grateful thanks to two prior open-source markdown servers whose hard-won
lessons are baked into the reading surfaces:

- **[mdserve](https://github.com/jfernandez/mdserve)** — Jose Fernandez, MIT. Watcher
  robustness across atomic editor saves, WebSocket reload-signal live reload, the
  pre-render-to-memory pipeline, path-traversal guarding, and port auto-increment on bind conflict.
- **[marky](https://github.com/GRVYDEV/marky)** — GRVYDEV, Apache-2.0. Recursive folder tree
  that respects `.gitignore`, atomic corrupt-resilient settings persistence,
  sanitize-before-serve, and nucleo-backed fuzzy search.
