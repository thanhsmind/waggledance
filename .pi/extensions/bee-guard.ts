// bee's Pi enforcement belt. This file holds ZERO guard rules of its own —
// every allow/deny/advisory verdict comes from `.bee/bin/bee hook <name>`, the
// exact same brain the Claude, Codex and OpenCode belts call
// (packages/bee/hooks/claude-hooks.json, .opencode/plugins/bee-guard.ts).
// This file only:
//
//   1. locates the bee STORE and the bee BINARY (mirrors claude-hooks.json's
//      project-then-main-worktree search, since a linked worktree checkout has
//      no vendored .bee/bin/bee of its own) — re-checked on EVERY call, never
//      once at load time, so an in-session `bee onboard` starts guarding
//      without a `/reload` (D1/CONTEXT.md "Agent's Discretion" passivity rule);
//   2. maps every Pi tool this extension routes onto the JSON shape the target
//      bee hook already reads on stdin — a field-name translation for the
//      enumerated built-ins, and a FAIL-SAFE write-capable route for every
//      name outside that map (see mapToolCall below); and
//   3. picks ONE of exactly two failure policies per surface, never a third:
//        BLOCKING (`tool_call` only) — write-guard. bee's documented DENY
//        verdict (exit code 2, reason on stderr) becomes Pi's documented block
//        return, `{ block: true, reason }` (Pi 0.84.3 docs/extensions.md
//        "tool_call"). Deny, crash, missing binary, an "ask" verdict and an
//        unparseable exit-0 verdict ALL block — D3 fail CLOSED, all the way
//        through.
//        ADVISORY (session_start, before_agent_start, tool_result,
//        agent_settled) — these NEVER throw and never block: a missing binary,
//        a spawn error, a crash, or any exit code is swallowed and logged to
//        stderr for a human to notice, never surfaced as a session-ending
//        exception. This is bee's own posture too — hooks/mod.rs's
//        `emit_undecidable` already resolves bee's OWN could-not-decide
//        outcome to exit 0 (fail-open BY DESIGN); this file's advisory wrapper
//        additionally swallows failures ON THE PI SIDE that never even reach
//        that native fail-open path. A fail-open host swallows a fail-CLOSED
//        throw right back into an allow — the one failure mode the BLOCKING
//        path above must never have, and exactly why the two policies never
//        mix on the same call (pattern 20260714).
//   4. drains this session's RESULT INBOX (pi-result-mailbox D4/D5/D6) — the
//      one surface here that is not a hook call at all. A detached
//      `bee herding run --inbox-session <token>` leaves a pending marker for
//      the orchestrator session whose id is that token; this file polls for
//      the marker's finished result and injects a HEADER into the session.
//      It is ADVISORY-class like everything in (3) above: it never throws and
//      never blocks, and its timer is created inside `session_start` (never at
//      load time) and `.unref()`d, so a host that merely imports this file can
//      still exit. See "the result-inbox drain" below.
//
// PASSIVITY (CONTEXT.md, Agent's Discretion): a repo with no `.bee` DIRECTORY
// at the project root or at the main worktree root is not a bee repo — every
// handler here returns without running anything and without printing anything.
// A `.bee` directory PRESENT with the binary MISSING is the opposite case: the
// repo IS bee-managed and the guard cannot decide, so the blocking path blocks
// (D3) and the advisory path logs. Both checks run per call, never cached.
//
// model-guard is a NAMED EXCLUSION on this belt — n/a — Pi has NO native
// subagent surface: no Agent tool, no Task tool, no subagent_type parameter
// anywhere in its built-in tool registry (store decision 7f9c8518; plan.md
// "model-guard is a NAMED EXCLUSION on Pi"). Every worker dispatch from a Pi
// session routes through the herding transport instead, which is a bee CLI
// call (`bee herding run`) and therefore already covered by write-guard on the
// `bash` tool. A model-guard row wired here would be a vacuous name-match that
// can never fire — the exclusion is asserted BY NAME in the belt parity test.
//
// codex-subagent-audit and chain-nudge are NOT wired here either, for the same
// reason they are not wired on the OpenCode belt: codex-subagent-audit is
// Codex-specific, and chain-nudge needs subagent-dispatch identity that no Pi
// event carries.

// at `.bee/result-inbox/<token>/<job-id>.json` BEFORE it splits the worker's
// pane. The marker is a POINTER — `job_id`, the job's `mailbox` directory, an
// optional `cell_id`, `created_at` — never a copy of the envelope, so there is
// exactly one copy of the truth. This drain is the other half: the orchestrator
// session whose own id IS that token polls its inbox, and the moment a marker's
// mailbox holds a finished `result-N.json` it injects a header into this
// session — steered into the running turn when busy, a fresh user turn when
// idle. The discipline below is pi-peer's, proven in shipped code
// (docs/history/research/pi-peer-distill.md), adapted to bee's typed envelopes
// rather than its free chat.
//
// Five properties this code exists to hold:
//
//   1. HEADER ONLY (D5). The injection carries a fixed row set of one-line
//      fields — job id, cell id, status, summary, proof, report_path — and
//      NEVER the report body. That is the anti-truncation choice (a long body
//      clipped by a host is an unreadable result) and the anti-fence-escape one
//      at the same time: a fixed shape whose every value is flattened to one
//      backtick-free line has no carrier for a fence a worker wrote into its
//      own report. The body stays on disk; `report_path` says where.
//   2. AT-LEAST-ONCE (D6). Nothing here remembers what was already delivered —
//      a claim that survives a crash is REQUEUED, so a restart can redeliver
//      the same job. That is the honest guarantee, and the injected header says
//      so out loud with `job_id` named as the dedupe key.
//   3. ONE DELIVERY PATH PER JOB (D6). Structural, and decided on the bee side:
//      only an `--inbox-session` dispatch leaves a marker, so a run the
//      orchestrator is synchronously waiting on can never also be injected.
