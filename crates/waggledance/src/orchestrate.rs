//! Protocol engine — the mechanical Herdr protocol (D1/D5): preflight a
//! target pane, mint a fresh split marker, capture a pre-send baseline,
//! send the task, and poll for completion, all as functions over `&dyn
//! Herdr` so the whole protocol is testable against `FakeHerdr` with no
//! live herdr and no MCP process (`waggledance mcp`, a later slice, calls
//! these functions; it owns no protocol logic of its own — see
//! `docs/history/orchestrator-dispatch/plan.md`'s phase table).
//!
//! Fail-closed throughout (D5): a send is refused before any pane write
//! unless the target is verifiably `Idle`/`Done`/`Unknown`; a snapshot
//! failure is treated as unverifiable, never as "probably fine". Completion
//! is proven only by a *fresh* split marker — present in a current read and
//! absent from the run's own pre-send baseline — never by a marker string
//! that merely happens to already be on screen (a prior run's own echo, or
//! an agent quoting the instruction back). `Unknown` status (no agent
//! status this app trusts) falls back to three consecutive unchanged
//! `ansi::revision_of` reads as a settled-content proxy for completion.
//!
//! Every item here is exercised by this module's own `#[cfg(test)]` suite
//! (against `FakeHerdr`); its production caller is `mcp.rs`'s
//! `waggledance_dispatch`/`waggledance_await` tools (phase 3, per
//! `docs/history/orchestrator-dispatch/plan.md`'s phase table).
