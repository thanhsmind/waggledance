//! Pure reader for a project's `.bee/` store — bee-cockpit Slice 1.
//!
//! Turns `<root>/.bee/` into a typed [`BeeSnapshot`]. This module is
//! deliberately framework-free (no axum/tokio/hyper) so it stays inside
//! `waggledance-core`, per the crate split documented at the top of `lib.rs`.
//!
//! Decisions honored here (see `docs/history/bee-cockpit/CONTEXT.md`):
//! - **D3** — presence is `<root>/.bee/` existing; absence is reported, not
//!   an error.
//! - **D4** — strictly read-only: every path here is opened for reading
//!   only, nothing is ever written.
//! - **D7** — cells sort into four buckets (Doing/Waiting/Stuck/Done);
//!   `dropped` and any unrecognized status land in none of them and are
//!   excluded from every count.
//! - **D8** — `active` is true iff at least one cell is `open` or `claimed`.
//! - **D9** — only live `.bee/cells/*.json` is read; `.bee/cells/archive/`
//!   stays unopened. `.bee/logs/tools.jsonl` gets exactly one bounded tail
//!   read (kanban-live-signals D1, below) — the file is never opened whole.
//! - **D10** — a feature is **shipped** when every one of its non-dropped
//!   cells is `capped`. A worktree merge into main is never consulted, and a
//!   dropped cell never blocks shipped status; a feature whose cells are
//!   *all* dropped is neither shipped nor counted.
//! - **D11** — a shipped feature's cycle time runs from the earliest
//!   `trace.claimed_at` to the latest `trace.capped_at` across its
//!   non-dropped cells. Either endpoint missing means no cycle time is
//!   reported — never a guessed zero.
//!
//! Slice 2 (bee-cockpit-5) extends the snapshot with the rest of the store —
//! backlog, sessions, lanes and workspaces — always **summarized**, never
//! dumped:
//! - `.bee/backlog.jsonl` mixes two row shapes. `kind == "pbi"` rows are
//!   event-sourced and folded by `id` to the LAST occurrence's status; every
//!   other row is a finding, grouped by `severity` (`P1`/`P2`/`P3`) with a
//!   bounded [`RECENT_DETAIL_CAP`]-sized "recent" slice alongside the true
//!   total.
//! - `.bee/sessions/*.json` sessions are `live` when `last_heartbeat` is
//!   within [`SESSION_LIVE_MINUTES`] of the read, `stale` otherwise, with the
//!   heartbeat age exposed in minutes. `transcript_path` is never read into a
//!   public field — it is an absolute path into the user's home.
//! - `.bee/lanes/*.json` (when present) surface per-feature lane state
//!   alongside the default pipeline's `.bee/state.json`.
//! - `.bee/runtime/workspaces/*.json` surface worktree/workspace records;
//!   `root` is relativized like every other path-shaped field.
//! - `.bee/decisions.jsonl` reports its true total event count plus only the
//!   most recent [`RECENT_DETAIL_CAP`] `decide` events — the full log is
//!   never loaded into the snapshot.
//!
//! bee-board-ux-4 adds worktree liveness: `.bee/runtime/worktree-grants.json`
//! (when present) names every currently-granted worktree. Each granted id is
//! resolved against its own **sibling** `.bee/` — that worktree's own
//! `state.json` for `feature`/`phase`/`mode`, and that worktree's own
//! `.bee/sessions/*.json` for liveness on the same [`SESSION_LIVE_MINUTES`]
//! window — then joined to the `branch`/`created_at` already read from this
//! project's own `.bee/runtime/workspaces/` records above. This is
//! deliberately **never** built from the worktree's own `.bee/cells/`:
//! measured live against a 14-worktree store, every granted worktree held a
//! stale snapshot of the very same live cell set this module already reads,
//! and the only cell any of them disagreed about was the SAME cell, still
//! `claimed` in their snapshot but long since `capped` in the real store.
//! Reading worktree cells into the board would resurrect that one finished
//! cell as in-flight once per worktree. See [`BeeWorktree`]. A dangling
//! grant — sibling directory gone, `state.json` missing or malformed — is
//! reported unresolved, never dropped and never fatal.
//!
//! bee-board-pm (bbp-4) adds [`BeeSnapshot::attention`] — D6's generated,
//! severity-ordered "needs attention" list, computed in
//! [`compute_attention_items`] purely from `buckets.stuck` and
//! `read_errors`, exactly as this module already computes
//! `running_workers` from data it has already read.
//!
//! kanban-live-signals (D1-D3, `docs/history/kanban-live-signals/CONTEXT.md`)
//! adds three more readers, all still read-only and error-tolerant:
//! - **D1**/**D2** — `state.json` gains `last_activity` (RFC 3339) and
//!   `run_state`, both `Option` on [`BeeState`] — a file from an older bee
//!   version that carries neither key still parses.
//! - **D1** — `.bee/logs/tools.jsonl` (~1.4 MB, append-only) is never read
//!   whole: this reader seeks to at most its last [`TOOLS_LOG_TAIL_BYTES`]
//!   bytes, drops the torn first line the seek point almost always lands
//!   inside, and keeps the newest `ts` it can parse as
//!   [`BeeSnapshot::last_tool_call`]. A missing file, an unreadable one, or a
//!   tail with no parsable `ts` yields `None` — a liveness signal, never
//!   pushed to `read_errors`.
//! - **D3** — `.bee/deferred-queue.jsonl` is folded by `id` to each id's
//!   LAST event; an id whose last event is `add` is unresolved debt, and any
//!   later event (an unrecognized future kind included) resolves it — see
//!   [`BeeDeferredQueue`].
//!
//! Every path-shaped value that crosses into a public field is rendered
//! relative to the project root (or reduced to a bare filename when it
//! falls outside the root) — no absolute path may survive into a
//! [`BeeSnapshot`]'s public fields. Malformed JSON degrades to a partial
//! snapshot with a note in [`BeeSnapshot::read_errors`] instead of
//! propagating an error that would take down a page render.

/// this board has no per-note feature name to name, so the title stays

/// never on a judgement of whether the note is still relevant (D6) — a
/// `"planned-next"` handoff is a different thing (a clean stop with the
/// next claim already owned) and never fires this rule.
///
/// bbp-9 adds a fourth, independent rule: a recorded `gate_bypass` that is
/// not off (source spec §5c: `gate_bypass_level` off is "stopping by the
/// rules"; anything else is "cảnh báo" — a warning). It fires on the value
/// [`read_config`]/[`normalize_gate_bypass`] already normalized, and its
/// wording names that value as the **recorded** setting only — never a
/// claim about what is actually being enforced, because
/// `.bee/config.local.json` can override it on a given machine and this
/// reader never opens that file (see [`BeeConfig`]).
///
/// bbp-13 adds three more, independent rules, each worded as user-invoked
/// work (D7) so nothing here reads as review already running on its own:
/// - `review.open_p1_findings` non-empty (🔴 critical — an open P1 in a
///   review that has not yet been settled is stronger signal than a count
///   of candidates nobody has looked at).
/// - An unreviewed candidate whose own `mode` is `high-risk` (🟠 serious —
///   `review.candidates` filtered to [`BeeReviewStatus::Unreviewed`] with
///   `mode == Some("high-risk")`).
/// - Knowledge debt (🟡 warning — Terms: "Capped work whose learnings were
///   never recorded", folded into the one number a human can act on):
///   `scribing_debt.len()` plus `capture_queue.waiting` plus the count of
///   features carrying an unapplied `promote_proposals` entry (bbp-12).
///
/// Adding a rule later means adding another `if` below and letting it fall
/// into the sort — the ones here are never touched to make room for it.
