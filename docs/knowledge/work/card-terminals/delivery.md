# card-terminals — Delivery

## What shipped

The cross-project Features board's cards now carry one marker per terminal
session running in that feature's own checkout, each opening that session's own
terminal view. (At the time this shipped the board had Waiting on you and In
Progress cards; since kanban-columns, In Progress is the only column that
renders cards.)

Nothing in the record ties a session to a feature — a session knows which
feature it works but not which terminal it occupies, and a terminal knows its
directory but not its feature — so the marking is decided by the checkout. For
a feature with its own branch checkout that is exact; for one working in the
main checkout the markers are shared with every other main-checkout feature,
and are labelled as the terminals of *this checkout* rather than the feature's
own.

Since board-pane-lane-pin (2026-08-23) a session that names its feature is
marked on that one card only; the checkout rule above now applies just to
terminals no session claims.

## Verify

`cargo test --workspace` green at 843, up from 837. Six new tests: two on the
card's own markup and its empty case, four through the router covering
worktree-versus-main scoping, a feature with no session, the terminal switch
off, and the Finished rows carrying none. The twelve existing home-page tests
stayed green and unedited.

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell trace.

## Provenance

`bee knowledge promote` proposed area-update bullets for this work item. They
were reviewed and not applied: each restated the cell's outcome in code terms —
function and file names — where an area spec takes business language only, and
the behaviour itself was already merged into the touched specs by hand. The
reason is recorded in the decision log.
