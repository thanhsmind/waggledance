# doctor-preserve-order — Delivery

## What shipped

- **dpo-1** — serde_json preserve_order enabled; doctor --fix no longer reorders ~/.claude.json keys (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **dpo-1** — `cargo test -p waggledance doctor`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work doctor-preserve-order` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/doctor-preserve-order.json`, `docs/history/doctor-preserve-order/promote-proposals.md`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "doctor-preserve-order" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-20T09:56:00.069Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area doctor:
  - [dpo-1] serde_json preserve_order enabled; doctor --fix no longer reorders ~/.claude.json keys — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dpo-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 1 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/doctor-preserve-order/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: **merged into `docs/specs/doctor.md`** — merged into "Apply safe fixes": the configuration file comes back in the order the operator wrote it, and the guarantee is structural rather than a rule someone must remember.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
