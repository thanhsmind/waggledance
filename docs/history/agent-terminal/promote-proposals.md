# agent-terminal — Delivery

## What shipped

- **agent-terminal-1** — Config resolves its data directory through an injectable override so settings handlers can be tested without touching the real ~/.mdview (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-2** — Ported herdr client into crates/mdview (mdview-core stays async-runtime-free) and the path boundary into crates/mdview-core/src/paths_boundary.rs, both with their existing tests green (12 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-3** — Add terminal_auth module: token store (0600 file), constant-time verify, session set, reveal-once masking, rotation clears sessions; opaque-404 extractor generic over HasTerminalAuth; no route mounted (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-4** — Issued and rotated the terminal token on the settings page (reveal-once, mask-after), and gated the D7 switches behind a terminal_auth-only endpoint separate from POST /api/config (3 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-5** — Added the gated GET /p/:id/_terminal pane list (D2/D4/D6), the project tab strip, and the MethodGate carry-over fix for POST /api/terminal-config (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-6** — Add the gated screen-poll endpoint (herdr-go's ScreenBody shape) plus the app.js poll loop, and enforce TerminalConfig.enabled across the whole terminal route family while keeping settings and the switch endpoint reachable (3 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-7** — Close the terminal-auth rotation race with a single-lock verify_and_mint, add a MethodGate extractor closing the method-mismatch 404/405 oracle, make the token write atomic (temp+rename, 0600), and surface Windows' unprotected state as a queryable flag (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-8** — Login route is the only caller of verify_and_mint and only place a session cookie is minted; rotation no longer mints, gated on current session once configured; Terminal tab present on every project (3 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-9** — Add gated POST input/keys endpoints for pane replies (D3), the reply bar + key buttons on the terminal page, and app.js wiring; submit-flag defaults to staged-not-sent (3 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-10** — Added the gated Unassigned group (routes, page, screen/input/keys, project-list presence marker) with route-level tests covering the partition, gating, and unauthenticated home page; cargo test --workspace green (337 passed). (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-11** — Pinned the unassigned route family's guards (session/method/switch), the socket-layer send-then-submit split, the token-mount method gate, MethodGate isolation, and fail-closed unassigned listing with a key-list bound (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-12** — Server-side ANSI-to-HTML translation renders coloured/styled terminal screens; unrecognised escapes dropped, text escaped before markup (6 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-13** — Added gated pane/agent creation routes with server-side workspace resolution and preset-based agent start; terminal page offers configured preset labels (3 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-14** — ANSI parser now drops DCS/APC/PM/SOS bodies whole and re-emits malformed-CSI abort bytes as text; creation routes gain MethodGate isolation and create_error_response coverage tests (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-15** — Ported herdr-go's gap-free transcript tailer into mdview-core with its full test suite and cursor path-escape guard (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-16** — Added the Transcript tab (D9) beside Terminal with a gated, cursor-based activity endpoint sharing the terminal family's full guard stack (3 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-17** — Ported the status watcher, herdr supervisor and at-least-once notification outbox (Notifier trait + null/Telegram) from herdr-go, inert — main.rs only declares the modules, guarded by a source-scan test proving nothing constructs or starts them (9 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-18** — Wired the supervisor and Telegram notifier behind their D7 switches via a new live-reconciling TerminalBackground manager; the credential follows the terminal-token secret-file pattern (4 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-19** — Fixed all 7 transcript reader defects: structural cursor path guard, oversized-record advance, truncation divider, boundary-correct backfill, clipped unknown types, honest poll-cap wording — 21 new/updated tests, full workspace suite green (1 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-20** — Pinned the transcript page's session/method gates with isolating tests and fixed the transcript poller's double-append and silent-failure defects (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-21** — Fixed the toothless off-switch (real tick-based proof + cancellation-before-spawn + wait-for-previous-task), added exponential backoff with per-step logging, randomised the credential temp name, logged its write failures, added an owner-only-mode test, and corrected four stale module docs (7 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-22** — Fixed the transcript poller's in-flight guard to clear only on settle (both success and failure paths), replaced two toothless grep-based tests with block-pinned assertions, and made the notify outbox open lazily only when the notify switch is on; the off-path cancellation assertions (item 5) remain bookkeeping-only pending agent-terminal-21's not-yet-landed real side effect in main.rs, named as a deviation rather than fabricated. (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-23** — Aligned the opening backfill's oversized-record handling with the tailer's so a still-writing record no longer leaves the cursor mid-record and storms a truncation divider; separated the cursor guard's empty-name and extension checks (stem-based) so each is independently load-bearing, with a new .jsonl:0 fixture proving it. (1 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-24** — Surface a failed Telegram credential save as failure not saved, and prove the off-assertions observe the tick side effect rather than the bookkeeping slot (2 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-25** — Corrected every no-auth claim in scope to name D4's carve-out, added docs/specs/agent-terminal.md, listed it in reading-map.md, and updated README (9 file(s) changed)
- **agent-terminal-26** — Corrected settings-gating, creation-body, and pane-listing claims; added 8 missing behaviours; stripped implementation vocabulary; distinguished agent from pane with a named open gap (1 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **agent-terminal-1** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **agent-terminal-2** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **agent-terminal-3** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **agent-terminal-4** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **agent-terminal-5** — `cargo test --workspace`

- **agent-terminal-25** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **agent-terminal-26** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

- **agent-terminal-7** — Removed the public verify(&str) -> bool entirely rather than merely privatizing it (no caller outside this module used it); kept mint_session() public because server.rs's rotate_terminal_token (owned concurrently by cell agent-terminal-4) calls it directly after rotate() on the settings-page rotation flow, which is not the verify()+mint_session() login composition the rotation race targeted -- old callers keep compiling unchanged.
- **agent-terminal-7** — Closed the rotation race with a single Mutex shared by rotate() and the new verify_and_mint() (mutual exclusion across the write+clear and read+compare+insert) rather than a token-generation counter -- both were authorised by the cell; the lock is the simpler structural fix.
- **agent-terminal-7** — Recorded, per the cell's closing instruction, that agent-terminal-3's first truth ("wrong token yields an opaque 404") is now a login-route obligation satisfied through verify_and_mint's caller contract (None on any failure) -- documented in terminal_auth.rs's module doc under "Note for the cell that mounts the first terminal login route", so the next cell that adds a login route inherits it explicitly rather than re-deriving it.
- **agent-terminal-7** — The method-mismatch fix is MethodGate<M> (an extractor) plus Get/Post marker types, not a MethodRouter fallback handler -- verified against axum 0.7.9 source (routing/method_routing.rs) that MethodRouter::fallback still lets axum attach an Allow header derived from registered methods even through a custom fallback, so no fallback-handler choice can close the oracle; routes must be mounted with axum::routing::any(handler) and MethodGate<Get>/MethodGate<Post> as the handler's first extractor. Documented in MethodGate's doc comment for the cells that mount terminal routes.
- **agent-terminal-7** — Windows-silence fix is a const fn token_file_permissions_enforced() -> bool (a compile-time platform fact via cfg!(unix)) rather than a stored runtime flag, since the property doesn't vary at runtime on a given build.

# agent-terminal cell agent-terminal-1 — pitfall candidate

## What the cell did

Config resolves its data directory through an injectable override so settings handlers can be tested without touching the real ~/.mdview

## Recorded evidence (verbatim from .bee/cells/archive/agent-terminal/agent-terminal-1.json)

- **failure_signature** — 1e3da6091bf0

## Status

Candidate only. `bee knowledge promote` proposes; naming the pattern, generalizing it beyond this cell, and moving `bee.lifecycle` to `active` are a human or agent decision.

# agent-terminal cell agent-terminal-7 — pitfall candidate

## What the cell did

Close the terminal-auth rotation race with a single-lock verify_and_mint, add a MethodGate extractor closing the method-mismatch 404/405 oracle, make the token write atomic (temp+rename, 0600), and surface Windows' unprotected state as a queryable flag

## Recorded evidence (verbatim from .bee/cells/archive/agent-terminal/agent-terminal-7.json)

- **deviation** — Removed the public verify(&str) -> bool entirely rather than merely privatizing it (no caller outside this module used it); kept mint_session() public because server.rs's rotate_terminal_token (owned concurrently by cell agent-terminal-4) calls it directly after rotate() on the settings-page rotation flow, which is not the verify()+mint_session() login composition the rotation race targeted -- old callers keep compiling unchanged.
- **deviation** — Closed the rotation race with a single Mutex shared by rotate() and the new verify_and_mint() (mutual exclusion across the write+clear and read+compare+insert) rather than a token-generation counter -- both were authorised by the cell; the lock is the simpler structural fix.
- **deviation** — Recorded, per the cell's closing instruction, that agent-terminal-3's first truth ("wrong token yields an opaque 404") is now a login-route obligation satisfied through verify_and_mint's caller contract (None on any failure) -- documented in terminal_auth.rs's module doc under "Note for the cell that mounts the first terminal login route", so the next cell that adds a login route inherits it explicitly rather than re-deriving it.
- **deviation** — The method-mismatch fix is MethodGate<M> (an extractor) plus Get/Post marker types, not a MethodRouter fallback handler -- verified against axum 0.7.9 source (routing/method_routing.rs) that MethodRouter::fallback still lets axum attach an Allow header derived from registered methods even through a custom fallback, so no fallback-handler choice can close the oracle; routes must be mounted with axum::routing::any(handler) and MethodGate<Get>/MethodGate<Post> as the handler's first extractor. Documented in MethodGate's doc comment for the cells that mount terminal routes.
- **deviation** — Windows-silence fix is a const fn token_file_permissions_enforced() -> bool (a compile-time platform fact via cfg!(unix)) rather than a stored runtime flag, since the property doesn't vary at runtime on a given build.

## Status

Candidate only. `bee knowledge promote` proposes; naming the pattern, generalizing it beyond this cell, and moving `bee.lifecycle` to `active` are a human or agent decision.

knowledge promote: 26 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 120 area bullet(s), 2 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/agent-terminal/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/agent-terminal.md` and `docs/specs/settings.md` and `docs/specs/web-interface.md` names `agent-terminal` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
