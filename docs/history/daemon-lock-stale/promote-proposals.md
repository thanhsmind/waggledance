# daemon-lock-stale — Delivery

## What shipped

- **dls-1** — Reproduced the hang: health_check's TcpStream::connect had no connect timeout, so a dead-port connect blocks indefinitely on a network that drops rather than refuses -- fixed with connect_timeout(500ms); also fixed stop_daemon killing by pid unconditionally (a recycled pid risk) by checking health_check before kill (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **dls-1** — `cargo test --workspace. The reproduction is the proof: a test that FAILS before the fix and passes after, driving the stop path against a stale lock naming a dead pid and a dead port, asserting it returns within a bounded time and clears the lock. Plus: (edge) a lock naming a pid that is alive but is not mdview — the process must not be killed and the lock must not be cleared blindly; (edge) no lock file at all still reports no daemon running; (regression) a genuinely live daemon is still stopped and its lock cleared; (regression) the orphaned-daemon guard at cli.rs:423 still refuses to clear the lock of a daemon that failed to die but still answers. State in the outcome what the root cause actually was, and say so plainly if it turned out not to be a hang at all.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work daemon-lock-stale` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "daemon-lock-stale" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-06T22:01:45.954Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/daemon-lock-stale/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/daemon.md` names `daemon-lock-stale` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
