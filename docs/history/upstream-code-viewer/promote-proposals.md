# upstream-code-viewer — Delivery

## What shipped

- **upstream-code-viewer-1** — Code viewer ported from upstream across twelve commits; topbar hand-merged to keep this fork's brand and menu; upstream's auth-dependent tests adapted (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **upstream-code-viewer-1** — `cargo test --workspace green at 886, up from 878 before the block. Two upstream tests that depend on upstream authentication are adapted: the login-token test is removed with its reason recorded in place, and the cookie argument is dropped from every http_get in the new Code tests. Live check after install: /p/<id>/_code/ and a source file both answer 200, the sidebar lists folders before files, the breadcrumb right half reads the file's language and size, and the brand still reads Bee Artifact.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work upstream-code-viewer` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "upstream-code-viewer" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-13T07:20:28.110Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area web-interface:
  - [upstream-code-viewer-1] Code viewer ported from upstream across twelve commits; topbar hand-merged to keep this fork's brand and menu; upstream's auth-dependent tests adapted — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/archive/upstream-code-viewer/upstream-code-viewer-1.json)

area system-overview:
  - [upstream-code-viewer-1] Code viewer ported from upstream across twelve commits; topbar hand-merged to keep this fork's brand and menu; upstream's auth-dependent tests adapted — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/archive/upstream-code-viewer/upstream-code-viewer-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 2 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/upstream-code-viewer/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/web-interface.md` names `upstream-code-viewer` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
