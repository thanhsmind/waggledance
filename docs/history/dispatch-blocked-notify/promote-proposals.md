# dispatch-blocked-notify — Delivery

## What shipped

- **dbn-1** — notify outbox carries run and project identity, migrates existing databases, and dedupes one row per run per status (1 file(s) changed)
- **dbn-2** — Run-aware Blocked/Timeout alert raised at await_run's status-persistence point, deduped via dbn-1's outbox constraint (4 file(s) changed)
- **dbn-3** — Switch wiring stands; the end-to-end link it claimed shipped as dbn-4, and merged main proves it green (1 file(s) changed)
- **dbn-4** — Wired await path to NotifyStore under opt-in switch and logged on enqueue failure (2 file(s) changed)
- **dbn-5** — Suppressed watcher pane alert when a dispatched run owns the pane (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **dbn-1** — `cargo test -p waggledance-core notify_store`
- **dbn-2** — `cargo test -p waggledance orchestrate`
- **dbn-3** — `cargo test -p waggledance reconcile`
- **dbn-4** — `cargo test -p waggledance mcp`
- **dbn-5** — `cargo test -p waggledance notify`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work dispatch-blocked-notify` from 5 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `docs/history/dispatch-blocked-notify/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/history/dispatch-blocked-notify/plan.md`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "dispatch-blocked-notify" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-20T09:49:41.742Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area notifications:
  - [dbn-1] notify outbox carries run and project identity, migrates existing databases, and dedupes one row per run per status — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-1.json)
  - [dbn-2] Run-aware Blocked/Timeout alert raised at await_run's status-persistence point, deduped via dbn-1's outbox constraint — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 4 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-2.json)
  - [dbn-3] Switch wiring stands; the end-to-end link it claimed shipped as dbn-4, and merged main proves it green — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-3.json)
  - [dbn-4] Wired await path to NotifyStore under opt-in switch and logged on enqueue failure — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-4.json)
  - [dbn-5] Suppressed watcher pane alert when a dispatched run owns the pane — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-5.json)

area orchestration:
  - [dbn-1] notify outbox carries run and project identity, migrates existing databases, and dedupes one row per run per status — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-1.json)
  - [dbn-2] Run-aware Blocked/Timeout alert raised at await_run's status-persistence point, deduped via dbn-1's outbox constraint — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 4 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-2.json)
  - [dbn-3] Switch wiring stands; the end-to-end link it claimed shipped as dbn-4, and merged main proves it green — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/dbn-3.json)

# dispatch-blocked-notify cell dbn-3 — pitfall candidate

## What the cell did

Switch wiring stands; the end-to-end link it claimed shipped as dbn-4, and merged main proves it green

## Recorded evidence (verbatim from .bee/cells/dbn-3.json)

- **failure_signature** — capped cell proved its own unit but not the end-to-end link

## Status

Candidate only. `bee knowledge promote` proposes; naming the pattern, generalizing it beyond this cell, and moving `bee.lifecycle` to `active` are a human or agent decision.

knowledge promote: 5 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 10 area bullet(s), 1 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog. The generated bullets
are each cell's outcome in implementation vocabulary, which a spec never carries
outside its Pointers, so each was checked as behaviour rather than pasted in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/dispatch-blocked-notify/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — **merged into `docs/specs/agent-terminal.md`** as what a dispatched run adds to the notification duty: one alert per run per human-blocking state, raised from the single place the transition is recorded, naming project, pane and run and nothing else, with the older pane-status alert suppressed while a run owns that pane, and armed by the same opt-in switch.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
