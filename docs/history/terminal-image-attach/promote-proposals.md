# terminal-image-attach — Delivery

## What shipped

- **terminal-image-attach-1** — Added POST /p/:id/_terminal/:pane_id/attach with switch/boundary guards, MIME allowlist + magic-byte sniffing, 10MB cap, 32-file pane cap, sanitized rand-named storage, and 10 route tests (1 file(s) changed)
- **terminal-image-attach-2** — Wired composer attach UI (picker, drag-drop, paste, chips, one-message send) gated to project terminal pages, with a render test proving Unassigned renders none of it (3 file(s) changed)
- **terminal-image-attach-3** — Prune stale attach files before the 32-file cap, quote whitespace paths in composeMessage, and pre-check upload size client-side (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **terminal-image-attach-1** — `cargo test -p mdview terminal_attach -- --nocapture reports the new attach tests green; cargo test --workspace stays green at cap`
- **terminal-image-attach-2** — `cargo test -p mdview terminal_page -- --nocapture shows the attach render assertions green (project page yes, unassigned no); cargo test --workspace stays green at cap`
- **terminal-image-attach-3** — `cargo test -p mdview terminal_attach -- --nocapture shows the prune/cap tests green; cargo test --workspace stays green at cap`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work terminal-image-attach` from 3 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `docs/history/terminal-image-attach/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/history/terminal-image-attach/plan.md`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "terminal-image-attach" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-08T12:25:51.121Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area agent-terminal:
  - [terminal-image-attach-1] Added POST /p/:id/_terminal/:pane_id/attach with switch/boundary guards, MIME allowlist + magic-byte sniffing, 10MB cap, 32-file pane cap, sanitized rand-named storage, and 10 route tests — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/terminal-image-attach-1.json)
  - [terminal-image-attach-2] Wired composer attach UI (picker, drag-drop, paste, chips, one-message send) gated to project terminal pages, with a render test proving Unassigned renders none of it — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/terminal-image-attach-2.json)
  - [terminal-image-attach-3] Prune stale attach files before the 32-file cap, quote whitespace paths in composeMessage, and pre-check upload size client-side — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/terminal-image-attach-3.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 3 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 3 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/terminal-image-attach/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: already stated in `docs/specs/agent-terminal.md` — the spec's "Attaching images to a reply" section already carries picker, drag and paste, and the size and count bounds.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
