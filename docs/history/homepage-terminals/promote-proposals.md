# homepage-terminals — Delivery

## What shipped

- **homepage-terminals-1** — Added the read-only Terminals tab to the homepage (HomeTab::Terminals, terminals_tab, terminals_menu_panes, data-term-base poller branch); D1-D5, D7, D8 covered; shipped in 1906813. (3 file(s) changed)
- **homepage-terminals-2** — Let the homepage Terminals tab type into the selected agent (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **homepage-terminals-1** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **homepage-terminals-2** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work homepage-terminals` from 2 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `docs/history/homepage-terminals/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/history/homepage-terminals/plan.md`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

None: the work item declares no bee.areas, so there is no area to sync (D19).

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 2 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 0 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, nothing was proposed

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/homepage-terminals/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record, so the generated draft would replace a
  written record with a list of cell ids.
- **(b) Area updates** — nothing proposed: the work item declares no `bee.areas`, so the generator had nothing to route (D19).
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none. No capped cell of this feature carries a
  deviation or a failure signature, which is what the generator mines.

Nothing here was skipped for later: the file proposes no change to make.
