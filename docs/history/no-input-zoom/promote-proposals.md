# no-input-zoom — Delivery

## What shipped

- **no-input-zoom-1** — Form fields rise to 16px on a touch pointer, so focusing the reply box or a settings field no longer zooms and sticks the layout magnified; desktop sizes and pinch-zoom are unchanged (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **no-input-zoom-1** — `cargo test --workspace green. New tests assert both halves survive: the app.css asset carries an @media (pointer: coarse) block setting .fg-input to 16px, and the terminal style block carries the same for .term-reply__text -- following the existing app.css assertion style at views.rs around line 5016.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work no-input-zoom` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "no-input-zoom" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-14T07:24:23.706Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area appearance:
  - [no-input-zoom-1] Form fields rise to 16px on a touch pointer, so focusing the reply box or a settings field no longer zooms and sticks the layout magnified; desktop sizes and pinch-zoom are unchanged — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/no-input-zoom-1.json)

area agent-terminal:
  - [no-input-zoom-1] Form fields rise to 16px on a touch pointer, so focusing the reply box or a settings field no longer zooms and sticks the layout magnified; desktop sizes and pinch-zoom are unchanged — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/no-input-zoom-1.json)

area settings:
  - [no-input-zoom-1] Form fields rise to 16px on a touch pointer, so focusing the reply box or a settings field no longer zooms and sticks the layout magnified; desktop sizes and pinch-zoom are unchanged — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/no-input-zoom-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 3 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/no-input-zoom/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/appearance.md` names `no-input-zoom` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
