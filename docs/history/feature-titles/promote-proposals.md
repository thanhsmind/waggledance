# feature-titles — Delivery

## What shipped

- **feature-titles-1** — Human titles + descriptions from CONTEXT.md; docs links on feature detail (3 file(s) changed)
- **feature-titles-2** — Replaced the feature detail Sub-agents tab with a Terminal tab listing/linking the project's live agent-terminal panes (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **feature-titles-1** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **feature-titles-2** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work feature-titles` from 2 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/feature-titles.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "feature-titles" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-11T15:24:00.862Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area bee-cockpit-board:
  - [feature-titles-1] Human titles + descriptions from CONTEXT.md; docs links on feature detail — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/feature-titles-1.json)
  - [feature-titles-2] Replaced the feature detail Sub-agents tab with a Terminal tab listing/linking the project's live agent-terminal panes — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/feature-titles-2.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 2 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 2 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/feature-titles/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/bee-cockpit.md` names `feature-titles` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
