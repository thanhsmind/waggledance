# board-trim — Delivery

## What shipped

- **board-trim-1** — Removed the Sessions and Process health panels (and their dead view helpers/CSS) from the bee board page, leaving the panels wrapper with only Backlog & review; kept the standalone Finished section per the action's literal two-panel scope (flagged truths/key_links mismatch as a deviation); retired/rewrote board-page tests asserting the removed markup (data-layer coverage in mdview-core stays green) and extended the layout regression test to pin section order and marker absence. (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **board-trim-1** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work board-trim` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/board-trim.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "board-trim" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-11T14:12:52.913Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

  - [board-trim-1] Removed the Sessions and Process health panels (and their dead view helpers/CSS) from the bee board page, leaving the panels wrapper with only Backlog & review; kept the standalone Finished section per the action's literal two-panel scope (flagged truths/key_links mismatch as a deviation); retired/rewrote board-page tests asserting the removed markup (data-layer coverage in mdview-core stays green) and extended the layout regression test to pin section order and marker absence. — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/board-trim-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/board-trim/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/bee-cockpit.md` names `board-trim` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
