# settle-test-gaps — Delivery

## What shipped

- **settle-test-gaps-1** — Three new tests cover read-error fall-through (exactly one pane.read then the Enter, Ok), submit=false (one text request, zero reads), and empty-text submit (one enter request, zero reads); two-requests test pinned to exactly 2 reads; between-read request shape asserted (pane_id, source visible, no lines); mod.rs trait doc now states the text comparison, not the dead revision field. Committed 4ee0e6e path-scoped during the sibling red; capped now against the fresh green run (1047 passed) (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **settle-test-gaps-1** — `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace green in the worktree. Quote the new tests' names from the passing run. For the read-error test, additionally quote the assertion proving exactly one pane.read. No mutation battery required this time -- these are new-branch coverage, not mechanism pins.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work settle-test-gaps` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/lanes/settle-test-gaps.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

None: the work item declares no bee.areas, so there is no area to sync (D19).

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 0 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, nothing was proposed

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/settle-test-gaps/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record, so the generated draft would replace a
  written record with a list of cell ids.
- **(b) Area updates** — nothing proposed: the work item declares no `bee.areas`, so the generator had nothing to route (D19).
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none. No capped cell of this feature carries a
  deviation or a failure signature, which is what the generator mines.

Nothing here was skipped for later: the file proposes no change to make.
