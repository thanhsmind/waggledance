# poller-inflight-guard — Delivery

## What shipped

- **poller-inflight-guard-1** — Added inFlightScreen[paneId] guard to the screen poller's pollOne (crates/waggledance/assets/app.js), mirroring the transcript poller's inFlight pattern: skip a tick if the pane's fetch is still outstanding, set before fetch, clear on both success and error settle paths. Interval, URL building, hasTarget/validTermBase bail-out, and transcript poller untouched. cargo test --workspace: 1025 passed green. JS-only guard has no repo harness (pure client timing) -- recorded per home-terminal-header-2 precedent: manual browser check on a project terminal page with a slow/hung pane confirms only one screen fetch per pane outstanding at a time. (1 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **poller-inflight-guard-1** — `cargo test --workspace green (unchanged Rust suite — the guard is client JS). Record the JS-only guard the way home-terminal-header-2 did: manual browser check that only one screen fetch per pane is outstanding at a time under a slow/hung pane. State it in the commit body and cap outcome.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work poller-inflight-guard` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/lanes/poller-inflight-guard.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

None: the work item declares no bee.areas, so there is no area to sync (D19).

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, nothing was proposed

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/poller-inflight-guard/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record, so the generated draft would replace a
  written record with a list of cell ids.
- **(b) Area updates** — nothing proposed: the work item declares no `bee.areas`, so the generator had nothing to route (D19).
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none. No capped cell of this feature carries a
  deviation or a failure signature, which is what the generator mines.

Nothing here was skipped for later: the file proposes no change to make.
