# bundle-mono-font — Delivery

## What shipped

- **bundle-mono-font-1** — Bundled JetBrains Mono offline (regular+bold woff2 data URIs) as --font-mono's leading face; added a server.rs test pinning the @font-face and token order; OFL licence copied to docs/licenses/JetBrainsMono-OFL.txt; README credits edit skipped as out of file-scope. (5 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **bundle-mono-font-1** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work bundle-mono-font` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/bundle-mono-font.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "bundle-mono-font" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-12T03:15:02.236Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/bundle-mono-font/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: already stated in `docs/specs/agent-terminal.md` — the spec already states that the monospaced type ships with waggledance itself and covers box-drawing, Vietnamese and the rest.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
