# home-terminal-parity — Delivery

## What shipped

- **home-terminal-parity-1** — Homepage terminal screen gains scroll history stack and pane identity line, mirroring pane_cards; app.js scroll handlers honour the pane's own data-term-base (3 file(s) changed)
- **home-terminal-parity-2** — Replaced the homepage Terminals tab's select switcher with the homepage-mode Agents drawer, added project-scoped create controls, and updated/added the affected server.rs tests (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **home-terminal-parity-1** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **home-terminal-parity-2** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work home-terminal-parity` from 2 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `docs/history/home-terminal-parity/plan.md`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

None: the work item declares no bee.areas, so there is no area to sync (D19).

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 2 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 0 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

<!-- bee:not-a-deferral: this section records a completed review with no outstanding action. -->

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, nothing was proposed

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/home-terminal-parity/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record, so the generated draft would replace a
  written record with a list of cell ids.
- **(b) Area updates** — nothing proposed: the work item declares no `bee.areas`, so the generator had nothing to route (D19).
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none. No capped cell of this feature carries a
  deviation or a failure signature, which is what the generator mines.

Nothing here was skipped for later: the file proposes no change to make.
