# unassigned-poller-guard — Delivery

## What shipped

- **unassigned-poller-guard-1** — Added a shared hasTarget(base, projectId) helper in app.js and used it as a per-element bail-out in the screen poller (pollOne) and the two posters loops (forms/keyGroups, covering input/keys/attach) so no element without a valid data-term-base or a page projectId ever fetches/posts /p/null/.... Rust boundary test in views.rs pins the markup contract (Unassigned page's <main> has no data-project-id and its panes carry no data-term-base; the project page's <main> carries data-project-id; the homepage Terminals tab's pane carries data-term-base). cargo test --workspace: 1023 passed. JS guard itself has no repo harness -- manual browser check recorded in the test doc comment: on /_terminal/unassigned no /p/null request fires across several poll ticks and Send posts once. (1 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **unassigned-poller-guard-1** — `cargo test --workspace green. A Rust boundary test in views.rs pins the markup contract the guard relies on: the Unassigned page (unassigned_terminal_page) renders <main class=fg-page> with NO data-project-id and its .term-screen panes carry NO data-term-base, while the project terminal page / homepage tab DO provide one of the two, so a guard that skips 'neither base nor projectId' targets exactly the Unassigned panes and nothing else. The JS guard itself has no repo harness: record it as a JS-only guard the way home-terminal-header-2 did, naming the manual browser check (on /_terminal/unassigned no /p/null request fires and Send posts once).`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work unassigned-poller-guard` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/unassigned-poller-guard.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "unassigned-poller-guard" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-16T02:13:31.945Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/unassigned-poller-guard/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: already stated in `docs/specs/agent-terminal.md` — the spec's "Which panes a page keeps polling and driving" already states that a pane a page cannot address is left entirely alone by it.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
