# homepage-tabs — Delivery

## What shipped

- **homepage-tabs-1** — shipped (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **homepage-tabs-1** — `cargo test --workspace green. Through the router: `/` and `/?tab=kanban` serve the Features section and no Projects listing; `/?tab=projects` serves the Projects listing and no Features section; both carry the tab strip with exactly one `fg-tab--on` and one `aria-current="page"`; an unknown, empty or repeated `tab` value resolves to Kanban; a request carrying `register_error` serves the Projects tab and its banner even when `tab=kanban` is asked for; and a state where no feature qualifies serves the Projects page with no `fg-tabs` strip at all. Existing homepage assertions that expect both sections on one response are updated -- grep server.rs for tests hitting `/` before finishing.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work homepage-tabs` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "homepage-tabs" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-14T10:12:34.318Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area bee-cockpit:
  - [homepage-tabs-1] shipped — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/archive/homepage-tabs/homepage-tabs-1.json)

area web-interface:
  - [homepage-tabs-1] shipped — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/archive/homepage-tabs/homepage-tabs-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 2 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/homepage-tabs/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: **merged into `docs/specs/bee-cockpit.md`** — merged into "Where it appears": the home page offers the board and the project list as two addressable surfaces, only the chosen one is built, and the strip survives an empty surface.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
