# cross-board — Delivery

## What shipped

- **cross-board-1** — Added read_rollup: synchronous multi-project roll-up returning per-root BeeSnapshot plus archived-feature ship times (D10) (1 file(s) changed)
- **cross-board-2** — Split bee_feature_hub_section into classify/render; added bee_cross_project_features_section merging per-project columns with D5 labels and D10/D7 Finished ordering/paging (1 file(s) changed)
- **cross-board-3** — Home page now composes a cross-project Live strip and Features board (D1) above the unchanged project list, gated on D8/D9, roll-up run off the async task via one spawn_blocking task per qualifying project (2 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **cross-board-1** — `cargo test --workspace. New unit tests in crates/mdview-core/src/bee.rs against scratch fixture directories: a roll-up over two roots returns one snapshot each in the order given; a feature whose archived cells all carry trace.capped_at reports the latest of them as its ship time; a feature with a mix of present and absent capped_at reports no ship time; a root with .bee/ but no archive contributes an empty archived-feature set rather than an error; a root whose archive holds an unparseable cell still yields the other features from that root. The existing no_web_framework_dependency_declared test at bee.rs:3604 stays green and unedited.`
- **cross-board-2** — `cargo test --workspace. The sixteen existing unit tests that call bee_feature_hub_section, bee_hub_finished_row, and bee_hub_finished_rows stay green -- twelve unedited, and the four that call the two renderer signatures directly updated only to pass the new arguments. The twelve feature_hub_* router tests in crates/mdview/src/server.rs stay green and unedited. New unit tests on the cross-project section: three projects with features in all three states place each feature in the same column its own project's board would and label it with its project; a merged Finished sequence orders timed entries newest first ahead of untimed entries ordered alphabetically; more than ten combined Finished entries page behind 'Show 10 more' with the remaining count taken from the merged total; the same feature slug owned by two projects renders as two rows with different labels and different links; a project contributing no features changes nothing.`
- **cross-board-3** — `cargo test --workspace. The twelve existing home_page_* router tests in crates/mdview/src/server.rs stay green and unedited, including home_page_script_selectors_match_the_markup_the_page_emits at server.rs:14339 -- the new sections are added above the existing list rather than reordering anything inside it. New router tests: a registry with several qualifying projects renders Live and Features above the project list with entries from more than one project; a registry where no project has .bee/ renders the page with neither section present; a registered root that no longer exists on disk is treated as non-qualifying rather than as an error; a project whose .bee/ holds a corrupt cell still leaves the other projects' entries on the page and the response is 200. The roll-up's blocking work is asserted structurally at the call site -- it runs inside spawn_blocking -- rather than by a timeout, because a timeout around spawn_blocking abandons the thread instead of stopping the read.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work cross-board` from 3 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `docs/history/cross-board/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/history/cross-board/plan.md`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "cross-board" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-12T17:14:13.260Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area bee-cockpit:
  - [cross-board-1] Added read_rollup: synchronous multi-project roll-up returning per-root BeeSnapshot plus archived-feature ship times (D10) — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/cross-board-1.json)
  - [cross-board-2] Split bee_feature_hub_section into classify/render; added bee_cross_project_features_section merging per-project columns with D5 labels and D10/D7 Finished ordering/paging — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/cross-board-2.json)
  - [cross-board-3] Home page now composes a cross-project Live strip and Features board (D1) above the unchanged project list, gated on D8/D9, roll-up run off the async task via one spawn_blocking task per qualifying project — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/cross-board-3.json)

area web-interface:
  - [cross-board-1] Added read_rollup: synchronous multi-project roll-up returning per-root BeeSnapshot plus archived-feature ship times (D10) — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/cross-board-1.json)
  - [cross-board-2] Split bee_feature_hub_section into classify/render; added bee_cross_project_features_section merging per-project columns with D5 labels and D10/D7 Finished ordering/paging — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/cross-board-2.json)
  - [cross-board-3] Home page now composes a cross-project Live strip and Features board (D1) above the unchanged project list, gated on D8/D9, roll-up run off the async task via one spawn_blocking task per qualifying project — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 2 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/cross-board-3.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 3 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 6 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/cross-board/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/bee-cockpit.md` and `docs/specs/web-interface.md` names `cross-board` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
