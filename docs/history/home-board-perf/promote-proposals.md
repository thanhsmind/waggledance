# home-board-perf — Delivery

## What shipped

- **home-board-perf-1** — Added a per-project Mutex<HashMap> cache on AppState keyed by a stat-only .bee/+docs/history fingerprint (max mtime, entry count); cross_project_rollup and bee_board now read through cached_read_rollup, read_snapshot/read_rollup stay pure. 4 new tests prove cache-hit Arc identity and invalidation on add/remove/edit. (1 file(s) changed)
- **home-board-perf-2** — Added isBoardRelevant predicate; home (!m) branch reloads only on docs/history-relevant changes. fmt/clippy/tests green (1056 passed). Manual browser check recorded per JS-only guard convention. (1 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **home-board-perf-1** — `cargo test --workspace green (CI triple fmt+clippy+test). New tests in server (or core): (1) two consecutive cached_snapshot calls on an unchanged fixture project return the same snapshot WITHOUT re-parsing — prove via a call counter, an Arc identity, or a spy that read_snapshot ran once; (2) touching/adding/removing a .bee file invalidates (second call re-reads); (3) changing a docs/history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md invalidates. Do not weaken any existing bee-snapshot test.`
- **home-board-perf-2** — `cargo test --workspace green (CI triple). The predicate is client JS with no repo harness: record the JS-only guard per home-terminal-header-2 (manual browser check: on / a changed list of only non-docs/history markdown does not reload, one containing a docs/history path does). If any Rust test asserts the old home-always-reloads behavior, none is expected — but if a served-HTML test references shouldReload, keep it green.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work home-board-perf` from 2 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/home-board-perf.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "home-board-perf" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-16T06:32:34.298Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area bee-cockpit:
  - [home-board-perf-1] Added a per-project Mutex<HashMap> cache on AppState keyed by a stat-only .bee/+docs/history fingerprint (max mtime, entry count); cross_project_rollup and bee_board now read through cached_read_rollup, read_snapshot/read_rollup stay pure. 4 new tests prove cache-hit Arc identity and invalidation on add/remove/edit. — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/home-board-perf-1.json)
  - [home-board-perf-2] Added isBoardRelevant predicate; home (!m) branch reloads only on docs/history-relevant changes. fmt/clippy/tests green (1056 passed). Manual browser check recorded per JS-only guard convention. — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 1 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/home-board-perf-2.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/home-board-perf/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: already stated in `docs/specs/bee-cockpit.md` — the spec already states that the front page refreshes only when the change concerns it, which is the reader-visible half of this work; the cache behind it is implementation.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
