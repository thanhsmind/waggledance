# term-frame-blocks — Delivery

## What shipped

- **term-frame-blocks-1** — Wrapped box-drawing frame runs in .term-frame divs, closing/reopening SGR spans across the boundary, so tables and TUI frames keep their grid on phones while prose still wraps (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **term-frame-blocks-1** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work term-frame-blocks` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/term-frame-blocks.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "term-frame-blocks" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-12T01:17:02.555Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area agent-terminal:
  - [term-frame-blocks-1] Wrapped box-drawing frame runs in .term-frame divs, closing/reopening SGR spans across the boundary, so tables and TUI frames keep their grid on phones while prose still wraps — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/term-frame-blocks-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 1 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in a sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog, checking each candidate
bullet against what the spec already states rather than pasting it in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/term-frame-blocks/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — the generated bullets are each cell's outcome in
  implementation vocabulary (function and type names), which a spec never carries
  outside its Pointers section, so none was applied as written. What the reader
  actually gained: already stated in `docs/specs/agent-terminal.md` — the spec already states that a pane with no scrollback shows exactly its current frame, at the full height of one pane frame.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none proposed for this feature.
