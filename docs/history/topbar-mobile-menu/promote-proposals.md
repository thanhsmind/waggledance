# topbar-mobile-menu — Delivery

## What shipped

- **topbar-mobile-menu-1** — The bar's navigation collapses into a checkbox-driven menu under 720px; the wide bar is unchanged (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **topbar-mobile-menu-1** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work topbar-mobile-menu` from 1 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "topbar-mobile-menu" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-08T03:00:30.370Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area web-interface:
  - [topbar-mobile-menu-1] The bar's navigation collapses into a checkbox-driven menu under 720px; the wide bar is unchanged — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/topbar-mobile-menu-1.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 1 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 1 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

<!-- bee:not-a-deferral: this section records a completed review with no outstanding action. -->

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog. The generated bullets
are each cell's outcome in implementation vocabulary, which a spec never carries
outside its Pointers, so each was checked as behaviour rather than pasted in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/topbar-mobile-menu/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — already stated in `docs/specs/web-interface.md` as the narrow-screen menu rule.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
