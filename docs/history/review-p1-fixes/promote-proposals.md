# review-p1-fixes — Delivery

## What shipped

- **review-p1-fixes-1** — Added a require_loopback_host middleware layer returning 421 for non-loopback/missing Host; 13 tests cover loopback pass-through, foreign-Host 421 with no side effect on config/terminal-config/register/unregister, and missing-Host 421. Closes DNS-rebinding + CSRF findings. cargo test --workspace green (1021). (1 file(s) changed)
- **review-p1-fixes-2** — Escaped the title inside layout() with esc(), covering all callers at one sink; added tests for injection, ampersand/quote escaping, plain-title no-op, and the reflected search_page path. (1 file(s) changed)
- **review-p1-fixes-3** — Closed the open data-* sanitizer allowlist (only data-sourcepos survives) and gated app.js's data-term-base reads behind a same-origin /p/<project>/... check (2 file(s) changed)
- **review-p1-fixes-4** — Gate a feature URL segment through validate_feature_name before joining it onto the archive path in read_archived_cells, covering bee_feature_detail's own call; new test proves traversal/separator/empty features read nothing while a normal slug still reads. (1 file(s) changed)
- **review-p1-fixes-5** — fmt clean, ~24 clippy errors fixed across bee.rs/ansi.rs plus files surfaced by cells 1-4/6 (main.rs, server.rs, views.rs, herdr/mod.rs, herdr/socket.rs, supervisor.rs, watcher.rs), commands.test widened to the CI triple, all three gates green (1022 tests, 5 suites) (1 file(s) changed)
- **review-p1-fixes-6** — Landed a Rust #[test] boundary assertion (no node-free JS harness exists in repo) proving shouldReload's term-screen guard: Kanban/Projects tabs never render .term-screen, Terminals tab with a selected agent pane always does. cargo test --workspace green (1022 passed). (1 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **review-p1-fixes-1** — `cargo test --workspace green. New server tests: a request with Host 127.0.0.1:7700 (and localhost, [::1]) passes through to its normal response on a sample GET and on POST /api/config; a request with Host evil.tld (or an attacker IP) to POST /api/config, POST /api/terminal-config, POST a register/unregister route, and a plain GET each returns 421 and the handler's side effect did NOT happen (config unchanged / project still registered); a request with no Host header returns 421. Reuse the existing test harness that builds the router with a fixture state.`
- **review-p1-fixes-2** — `cargo test --workspace green. New view test: layout() given a title containing </title><script>alert(1)</script> renders it with the angle brackets escaped (no live </title> or <script> in output); a title with & and " is escaped; a plain title renders unchanged apart from escaping. If a reflected path is cheap to assert, add: search_page with q=</title><script> produces an escaped <title>. Existing layout/page tests stay green.`
- **review-p1-fixes-3** — `cargo test --workspace green. New render/sanitizer test: a markdown input containing <pre class="term-screen" data-pane-id="x" data-term-base="https://evil.tld/x"> passes through sanitize() with data-term-base (and any non-allowlisted data-*) STRIPPED, while a legitimately-emitted data-* the renderer produces (e.g. data-sourcepos) survives. Assert on the sanitized HTML string. The app.js same-origin check has no Rust harness -- record it as a JS-only guard the way home-terminal-header-2 did, naming the manual browser check (a hostile data-term-base is not fetched).`
- **review-p1-fixes-4** — `cargo test --workspace green. New bee.rs test: read_archived_cells with feature values '../../etc', '..%2F..' (already-decoded to ../..), 'a/b', and '' each return an empty Vec and touch no file outside root/.bee/cells/archive; a normal feature slug still reads its archived cells from a fixture. If a sibling reader shares the segment, it gets the same test.`
- **review-p1-fixes-5** — `Fresh and quoted: cargo fmt --all --check exits clean; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings exits clean (0 errors); cargo test --workspace green. This cell's own cap must run the widened commands.test and pass all three. Quote the tail of each in the cap message.`
- **review-p1-fixes-6** — `cargo test --workspace green. Either: a new automated assertion over shouldReload's three cases passes; OR an explicit recorded-gap note in the cell trace naming the manual verification plus a bee backlog add for the JS harness. State which path was taken and why in the cap message.`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work review-p1-fixes` from 6 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`, `.bee/lanes/review-p1-fixes.json`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "review-p1-fixes" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-16T01:12:52.802Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, the spec already records this feature

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/review-p1-fixes/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — not applied. `docs/specs/daemon.md` names `review-p1-fixes` in its own
  `sources`, which is the receipt that this feature's behaviour was merged into
  the spec when it closed. The generated bullets restate the same work in
  implementation vocabulary — function and type names — which a spec carries only
  in its Pointers, so applying them would add nothing the spec does not say and
  would break its vocabulary rule. This resolution rests on that receipt and on
  the spec owning the area, not on a line-by-line re-reading of every bullet.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
