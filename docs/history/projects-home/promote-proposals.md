# projects-home — Delivery

## What shipped

- **projects-home-1** — Badge every project row with its own boundary-matched terminal panes, gated on terminal.enabled with a timeout-wrapped snapshot (3 file(s) changed)
- **projects-home-2** — Added the D7/D8 add-project form and register route, with the D9a/D10 ordered validation (bounded pre-flight, deny-list, canonical-path duplicate check) plus the two carried-over badge-slice test gaps (4 file(s) changed)
- **projects-home-3** — Closed D9b deny-list containment gap, moved register validation off the async thread, restored the switch-off badge test, and split the store-failure/time-budget/duplicate-query-key edge cases into their own honest codes (3 file(s) changed)

## Verify

Each cell below was capped only against a recorded passing verify result — bee refuses a cap without one.

- **projects-home-1** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **projects-home-2** — `cargo test --workspace`
- **projects-home-3** — `cargo test --workspace`

## Deviations

None recorded in the capped cell traces.

## Provenance

Proposed by `bee knowledge promote --work projects-home` from 3 capped cell trace(s) in `.bee/cells/` and the anchor `.bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl`. Every line above is copied from a trace or from the work item; nothing here is curated truth until a human or agent accepts it.

(b) AREA UPDATES — candidate spec-sync bullets, each citing its cell

areas: from the scribing stamp for "projects-home" — .bee/logs/scribing-runs.jsonl's most recent entry (2026-08-08T02:18:38.234Z), the work item declares no bee.areas.

area web-interface:
  - [projects-home-1] Badge every project row with its own boundary-matched terminal panes, gated on terminal.enabled with a timeout-wrapped snapshot — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-1.json)
  - [projects-home-2] Added the D7/D8 add-project form and register route, with the D9a/D10 ordered validation (bounded pre-flight, deny-list, canonical-path duplicate check) plus the two carried-over badge-slice test gaps — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 4 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-2.json)
  - [projects-home-3] Closed D9b deny-list containment gap, moved register validation off the async thread, restored the switch-off badge test, and split the store-failure/time-budget/duplicate-query-key edge cases into their own honest codes — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-3.json)

area agent-terminal:

  - [projects-home-2] Added the D7/D8 add-project form and register route, with the D9a/D10 ordered validation (bounded pre-flight, deny-list, canonical-path duplicate check) plus the two carried-over badge-slice test gaps — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 4 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-2.json)
  - [projects-home-3] Closed D9b deny-list containment gap, moved register validation off the async thread, restored the switch-off badge test, and split the store-failure/time-budget/duplicate-query-key edge cases into their own honest codes — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-3.json)

area system-overview:
  - [projects-home-1] Badge every project row with its own boundary-matched terminal panes, gated on terminal.enabled with a timeout-wrapped snapshot — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 3 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-1.json)
  - [projects-home-2] Added the D7/D8 add-project form and register route, with the D9a/D10 ordered validation (bounded pre-flight, deny-list, canonical-path duplicate check) plus the two carried-over badge-slice test gaps — feature-wide sync per the scribing stamp, 4 file(s) changed (trace .bee/cells/projects-home-2.json)

(c) PATTERN CANDIDATES — candidate bee.pattern concepts, bee.polarity pitfall

None: no capped cell trace carries a deviation or a failure signature.

knowledge promote: 3 capped cell(s) mined, 1 delivery draft, 9 area bullet(s), 0 pattern candidate(s), 0 file(s) written.

## Resolution — 2026-08-25, reviewed against the spec

Reviewed in the sweep of the unapplied-proposal backlog. The generated bullets
are each cell's outcome in implementation vocabulary, which a spec never carries
outside its Pointers, so each was checked as behaviour rather than pasted in.

- **(a) Delivery draft** — not applied. `docs/knowledge/work/projects-home/delivery.md`
  already exists as a curated record.
- **(b) Area updates** — already stated in `docs/specs/web-interface.md` under "Which sessions are running where" — one marker per session whose folder sits inside that project, matched by the same boundary rule as everywhere else.
- **(c) Pattern candidates** — none promoted from here.
